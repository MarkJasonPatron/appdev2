## 1. What went well
- I learned a lot about **Git and GitHub** commands and now I feel more confident using it unlike the first time where I was like a baby crawling in the dark.
- As a team I feel that we are united and had each other's back so we didn't fight a lot.
- Our project went well at least on my opinion even if it still has a lot of room for improvements.

---

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges
- We didn't freeze our code like what Ms. Giselle had told us too and that made our system messy in the presentation day. 
- We keep adding new features that weren't critical in our system and it made it more complex. 
- As a group I feel like we could've done better if we weren't too complacent in doing our project.

## 3. Key Learnings
- Thanks to the refresher, I learned more about **JavaScript and Vite**.
- Learned that as a team we should help each other instead of fighting one another.
- Communicate with other team members to avoid misunderstandings.

---

## 4. Areas for Improvement
- Practice anything I didn't get or understand.
- Learn more about proper routing.
- Practice proper **time management** for myself.

---

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)
- I hope to learn more about mobile development, how different is it from web development like what tools are used and such, and best practices for mobile UI/UX.   
- Even if I don't plan to be a developer, I hope that I can at least understand **React Native fundamentals**.
- I want to learn **TypeScript** because as Sir Elmer have said, it is now the new normal to use instead of JavaScript.
